            <h2>Essay</h2>
            <p>
                My name is Sofiya, I am 19 years old. Since childhood, I have loved art and intellectual 
                games. I have been playing chess since I was three years old, and this game has become 
                an integral part of my life. In high school, I organized and judged chess tournaments at 
                the regional and national levels, striving for the title of orbiter. I was only 
                two tournaments short of achieving this goal, but the experience I gained was invaluable.

                I really like to draw and prefer abstractionism and surrealism. These styles allow me to 
                express inner emotions and ideas through unusual shapes and colors. Two of my paintings were 
                sent to an exhibition in Belarus, which was an important achievement for me and motivated me
                 to develop further in this direction.

                Another of my passions is music. During my school years, I was a rhythm guitarist in a musical
                 group, where we performed our favorite compositions and created our own. Besides music and
                  drawing, I find inspiration in reading books, which are portals to other worlds for me.
